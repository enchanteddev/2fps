# 2FPS: Very Primitive Frame adder

- go through each frame
- blend the current frame with the previous frame
- add this new frame in the middle of the two
- save the new video file with now twice the fps

Improvements are noticable only in some situations. 30fps -> 60fps won't feel like true 60fps
